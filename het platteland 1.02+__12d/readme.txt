Het Platteland, or The Countryside, is a map based on one from Red Alert 2. Inspired by C&C and Grey Goo expert Technique, I created this map to be new and inventive.
There are special features that take strategy to the next level. With a large map and long distances, you need to be a good rusher to go hard early game. If you're in it
for the long run, then this is your map. With flat open bits and lots of Tiberium I paved the way for all out battles. Say hello to scorp spam and all out warfare!
