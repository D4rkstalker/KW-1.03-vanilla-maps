Game:                 Command & Conquer 3
Mission Name: 	Sandstorm
Side: 		GDI
Briefing: Nod have set up a few bases in this desert area. We're dispatching a Commando and a couple of Snipers for you. Take out the Nod bases. You MUST keep the Commando alive!

This is a somewhat difficult mission. You'll have to do a bit of thinking to take out all the bases. Use your snipers and Commando wisely. Your snipers can easily pick off the enemy soldiers from a distance. Use your Commando to blow up the buildings, etc. Of course, he can also slice & dice enemy soldiers quickly. 


INSTALLATON: Simply place the map folder where you place other C&C3 user created maps. Fire up the game and go to the 'Skirmish' tab and then select 'Custom Maps'. When you get to the Custom Maps section, select [GDI]Sandstorm to play the mission.

NOTE: If you don't know where to install user created C&C3 maps or missions, check the url below for instructions:
